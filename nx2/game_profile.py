"""The game profile: the one place that says which game a build is for, and which addresses, offsets and keys are
that game's rather than the engine's.

The lifter, the Horizon runtime and the Vulkan back end are general; a handful of things are not, and before this file
they were written as literals wherever they were needed: patch modules for one build of one game, offsets into one
game's graphics module, the return address that identifies that module, one game's shader program keys, and the one
build make_game.py accepts. Retargeting meant finding them all, which is the work this file exists to stop repeating.

This is the same seam as Lakitu's (the Mario Kart World fork: nx2/game_profile.py, game/game_profile.h, the GAME_*
macros), so that a profile written for one fork reads the same in the other. Dragoon adds three things it needs:

  - the game is chosen by the build id of the dump's main, as host/hos_main.c's hos_game_is_mkw() always did, and
    not only by a switch: for_build() below. HOOKSHOT_GAME=<key> still overrides it.
  - the return address the runtime captures the graphics module at (Hooks), which was the one place the runtime
    recognised Ocarina by an address on every run, whatever the game.
  - how many Npads the game is served by default (HOS_NPAD_PLAYERS still overrides it).

What belongs here: the game's identity (program id, version, main's build id) as nx2/dump.py reports it; the base of
its main in the lifted image; which lift patch modules and which code patch module apply; the offsets into its
graphics module the frame pacing reads; the return addresses the runtime recognises; the shader program keys the
renderer treats specially; its default player count. What does not: anything true of every Switch 2 title, and the C
text a patch writes, which lives with the patch.

An unknown value is None, never a plausible-looking number. None switches its feature off: the runtime never captures
a graphics module it has no return address for and skips a pacing field it has no offset for, saying so once; a game
with no patch modules is lifted without patches. A wrong address, by contrast, is silent corruption in someone's game.
Every lift patch module also checks the instruction word at each of its sites and leaves a site out when it differs,
so a profile aimed at the wrong build turns its patches off rather than writing C after the wrong instruction.

Which profile: HOOKSHOT_GAME=<key> if set; else the profile whose build id the dump's main has (for_build); else, with
no build id to go by (a build or a check without a dump), DEFAULT. A dump whose build no profile knows gets NONE, which
patches nothing and hooks nothing: lifting an unknown game must not apply Ocarina's patches to it.
